# Traffic_signal_classifier
The project is done as part of Udacity self Driving Car Nano Degree Program. 
A deep learning CNN model for classification of German Dataset of Traffic signal Classifier.

In this project we use a Lenet CNN architecture for classification as German Traffic Signal Dataset. The link to the dataset used is https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/February/5898cd6f_traffic-signs-data/traffic-signs-data.zip. 
Read the Writeup to understand better the performance and architecture of the model used, parameters tried and the training and test accuracies.
For running install all the dependencies, and download and unpack the datset
